# Experiment 3.1: Original code
I cloned and implement the YewChat and SimpleWebsocketServer. After that I configure several things on my local machine. Then, I create 3 users that interact each other in the same chat room. Take a look on how it is look like below. I haven't change the design style.

# Experiment 3.2: Add some creativities to the webclient
Since I am working on this advanced programming task in the middle of the night, I decide to implement a simple idea: I want to create my chat application with a dark mode. So, I change the background color of the chat bubbles to dark gray. Then, I ensure that the bubble chat background color remains light. I also maintain the color of the sidebar to ensure contrast. However, I darken the color of the user card list. Additionally, I change the title to "Hubungi Temanmu!" to make it sound friendlier.
